# LLULLIAN ART 

## Introduction

### GA Subset
The Llullian Art that I introduce here is by no means the original one, and by that I mean the classic Ars Generalis Ultima and it's minor brother the Ars Brevis written by the magnificient Philosopher and Scientist Raimon Llull around by the 13th century.

This is my modern, artistic and personal vision of it, and do not pretend by no means copy the original.

Having said that, my admiration for the Beatus Raimon Llull as a source of inspiration is so big that I wanted to pick some ideas of his beloved art and play with them with the new media technologies we have today.

In this way I have defined my personal vision of Llulliand Art as a subset of the Generative Art movement.

[For a better understanding of who is Ramon Llull and his Ars follow the following link:](http://quisestlullus.narpan.net/eng/index_eng.html) 

### LA Manifesto
The main palette of objects of this specific Generative Art is exposed as follows:

* **INTENTION**: 1st: LOVE, 2nd: SCIENCE
* **SHAPES**: CIRCLE, TRIANGLE, SQUARE
* **COLORS**: GREEN, RED, YELLOW, BLACK, WHITE
* **LETTERS**: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K

### Goals
With the following experiments I try to mix very different and distant concepts like ART, SCIENCE, MODERN, OLD, CODE, GENERATION, LIFE, MUSIC, RELIGION, METAPHYSICS, INTUITION and LOVE.

This is a 'controlled' experiment, as such I know the ingredients I'm going to use. I know the ingredients and I have been using them for longtime now. The idea is to start with a simple pallette of ingredients and through code and intuitin see experiment after experiment where and how I want to express best myself.

Most importantly is to enjoy the experience.

### Concepts
* Programming: variables, for loops, classes, p5js functions.
* Mathematics: translations, modulo, sin and cos functions, random.
* Sound: Amplitude, Frequencies, Rytm, Melodies.

### Structure
This introduction for creating Llullian Art with p5JS course is divided into:

* Introduction
* Experiment-1
* Experiment-2
* Experiment-3
